Indoor Rover 2024



Overview
Indoor Rover 2024 is an autonomous robotic platform designed for indoor navigation and exploration. Built with advanced robotics, sensor integration, and path-planning algorithms, this project focuses on operating in GPS-denied environments, offering reliability and precision.

This open-source project includes hardware schematics, software code, and detailed documentation to empower users in building, customizing, and learning from the rover's design.

Key Features
Autonomous Navigation: Real-time obstacle avoidance and efficient routing.
Sensor Integration: Supports LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras for perception.
Path Planning: Uses advanced algorithms for collision-free movement.
Remote Control: Operable via mobile or web interfaces.
Modular Design: Flexible to accommodate different use cases.
Open-Source: Encourages collaboration and learning through shared resources.
